## iOS 3D Scanning App (Business side)
3D scanning app using iPhone depth-sensing front camera to generate model of scanned object. Has AR feature to place model into an AR space.

iOS app project is in /StandardCyborgCocoa-mastercopy3/StandardCyborgExample folder. It has the function of 3D scanning for objects, mainly food. Afterwards the model can be placed into an AR scene.

Changing the template project name is too much work due to the dependancies to the name so we just left it like that.

## Android AR Display App (Client side)
An Android app that utilizes the ARCore and Sceneform SDKs to display 3D models generated by the iOS scanning app. Incorporates AR to display the model on to a planar surface detected by the app.

The app uses ARCore to detect planes and surfaces that can be projected on and uses the Sceneform SDK to the display 3D models of scanned food.

Dependancies required are FireBase API and StandardCyborg API
