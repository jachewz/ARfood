# ARfood 

3D scanning app using iPhone depth-sensing front camera to generate model of scanned object. Has AR feature to place model into an AR space.

iOS app project is in /StandardCyborgCocoa-mastercopy3/StandardCyborgExample folder. It has the function of 3D scanning for objects, mainly food. Afterwards the model can be placed into an AR scene.

Changing the template project name is too much work due to the dependancies to the name so we just left it like that.
